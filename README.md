# Advent of Code 2022 - my solutions
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 coding challenges.

I have paid particular attention to code readability and solution simplicity (not overengineering solutions) to make them easy to understand for others. Code modularisation and re-use of code have also been taken into account (see utils.py).

All of the solutions give the correct answers to the challenges for both the test data and actual data.

From adventofcode.com: "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."
