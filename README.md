# Advent of Code 2022 - my solutions
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 coding challenges.

I have paid particular attention to code readability and solution simplicity (not overengineering solutions) to make them easy to understand for others. Code modularisation and re-use concepts have also been taken into account.

All of the solutions give the correct answers to the challenges.

From adventofcode.com: "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."
