# Advent of Code 2022 - my solutions
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 coding challenges.

I have paid particular attention to code readability and solution simplicity (not overengineering solutions) to make them easy to understand for others. I have used a object-oriented approach where appropriate and have included a utils.py module to allow for effective re-use of code.

All of the solutions give the correct answers to the challenges for both the test data and actual data.

From adventofcode.com: "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."
